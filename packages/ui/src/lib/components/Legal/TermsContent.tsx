          <span className="underline">Assignment &amp; Enurement</span>.
          Oneirocom may assign this Agreement at any time, with or without
          notice to you. You may not assign your rights or delegate your duties
          under this Agreement, either in whole or in part, without Oneirocom’s
          prior written consent in each instance. This Agreement will enure to

        <li>
          <span className="underline">Non-Waiver</span>. Oneirocom’s failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not
          operate as a waiver of such right or provision. Waivers will not be
          effective unless in writing and duly authorized by an officer of
          Oneirocom.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span className="underline">Severability</span>. The invalidity or
          unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement will not affect
          the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
          Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. Upon
          determination by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction that
          any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such
          provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible in
          accordance with its original intent.

          <span className="underline">Interpretation</span>. This Agreement was
          written in the English language. If this Agreement is translated into
          another language, the English language text will in any event prevail.
          Unless the context otherwise requires, words importing the singular
          include the plural and vice versa, and words importing gender include
          all genders. Where the word “including” or “includes” is used in this
          Agreement, it means “including (or includes) without limitation”. The
          contra proferentem rule will not apply to the interpretation of this
          Agreement. Headings are for convenience of reference only.

          <span className="underline">Governing Law</span>. This Agreement is
          governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the Province of
          British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable
          therein, without regard to principles of conflicts of law that would
          impose the law of another jurisdiction, and you agree to submit to the
          exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the Province of
          British Columbia, Canada. However, the foregoing will not limit
          Oneirocom’s right to enforce this Agreement in any other jurisdiction
          if reasonably necessary or advisable in our sole discretion.
